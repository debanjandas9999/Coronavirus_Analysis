Abstract 

This research project focuses on a new, emerging global problem: the ongoing 
outbreak of the coronavirus disease [COVID-19]. The outbreak started in China in late 
2019 and by April 2020 the disease has spread to countries around the world affecting 
more than 3 million people. Factors affecting the severity of this outbreak are being 
looked into with a very cautious approach as there is a possibility that many factors are
still not known to understand the scale of the COVID-19 outbreak, and respond 
appropriately. Data collected from John Hopkins GitHub Repository and Our World in 
Data has been used to compare the impact of different factors (Population density, 
Country’s percentage of older population, hospital beds, temperature) on cases and 
deaths per million. Two important factors: testing and mobility have been discussed in 
detail. These two factors have been found to have a certain correlation with the growth 
rate of cases. It is unknown by us, or any other research, governmental or reporting 
institution, about the actual impact of these factors. Based on the correlation, it has been 
observed that a country tends to have a higher growth rate with low testing levels (during 
initial stages) and high mobility rates. It should be taken care that correlations do not 
imply causation and hence, these events can not be guaranteed as there might be other 
factors in play.

Research Questions

This project is based on three research questions which would be discussed in this subsection. 

RQ1: What factors affect the severity of Covid-19 outbreak within a country? 

This is an attempt to find out some possible factors and check how do they correlate with cases and 
deaths per million on a country level. Various factors like population density, temperature, testing, 
mobility, hospital beds and country’s population percentage of senior citizens have been discussed. 

➢ How do the factors correlate to cases and deaths per million?

➢ Discussion on some important factors. 


RQ2: Has lockdown and social distancing measures reduced the number of cases 
globally?

This gives us a deeper insight of the lockdown strategies of some highly affected countries. A timeseries graph has been produced for countries to check if the decrease in mobility has any effect on the 
growth rate of cases.

➢ Has the lockdown been strict enough to bring a strong decrease in mobility rates? If yes, did 
the growth rates start reducing?

➢ Is there any relationship between the time taken to implement a lockdown and the country’s 
growth rate before lockdown?

RQ3: Why has there been a sharp increase in the number of cases in US? 

A case study to check if the factors discussed in the preceding questions are reasons behind the 
country’s worsening situation. An in-depth analysis of certain US states has been carried out to check 
if the trends discovered in Research Question 1 and 2 holds true.

➢ How is US doing in terms of mobility and testing? 

➢ Does this case study support the previous findings?
